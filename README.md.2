Questions for Laura:
1. Where will we be storing state for our messages. In App.js .. or 
    messages.. ?
2. Need help figuring out how Form works with logging in as opposed to 
creating an account for Sign up.
3. Do you want the Eybrow on the App so it is on each page, or do you want 
a different 'eyebrow' for each page ?
4. A visual mock up will help me re arange these components as needed and 
also will be able to organize routes and components better.
5. How do you want each page to look like ? (functionality wise !styling)
6. What are the key priorities that NEED to be done. 

NEED TO DO:
1. Use scrum board
2. Need 10 API endpoints. 
3. Must use some components from a component
    library. (can import a navbar, also icons)
4. Well organized structure of files, naming 
    conventions hold a pattern.
    A component should not do more than its name
        suggests.
5. Need to be able to describe our work on  
    project.
6. At least one advanced feature.(trending area)
7. Attended/ Stand up forms
